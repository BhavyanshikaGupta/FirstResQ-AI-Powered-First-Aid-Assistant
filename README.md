Backend Setup (Flask)
```bash
Copy code
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirement.txt
python app.py
```
Backend runs on:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Frontend Setup (React)
```bash
cd kid-aid-bot
npm install
npm run dev
```
Frontend runs on:
```bash
http://localhost:8080
```

## AI Working

- User inputs a symptom in natural language
- Sentence-BERT encodes the query
- Cosine similarity is computed against a curated first-aid dataset
- The most relevant first-aid response is returned in real time

## 🔊 Raspberry Pi Voice Assistant Device

FirstResQ also supports a standalone Raspberry Pi–based voice assistant device, enabling hands-free first aid guidance without requiring a browser or smartphone.

The device captures user speech via a microphone, sends the transcribed text to the Flask backend over HTTP, and outputs the AI-generated first aid response through a speaker and on-screen display.

### 🧠 Device Capabilities

- Voice-based symptom input using microphone
- Real-time speech-to-text processing
- Server-based AI inference (lightweight edge device)
- Text & audio response output
- Works on local network with Flask server

### 🧰 Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (Pi 3 / Pi 4 recommended)
- USB Microphone
- Speaker or Headphones
- Display (optional, for text output)
- Raspberry Pi OS

### 🛠️ Device Software Stack

- Python 3
- SpeechRecognition
- Requests
- Pygame
- Google Speech API (via SpeechRecognition)

### 📡 Device–Server Communication Flow

- User speaks a symptom into the microphone
- Raspberry Pi converts speech → text
- Text is sent to Flask /chat/<session_id> API
- Backend processes input using SBERT similarity search
- First aid response is returned
- Raspberry Pi displays and speaks the response

### ▶️ Raspberry Pi Setup & Execution

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip portaudio19-dev
pip3 install SpeechRecognition requests pygame pyaudio
```

Update the server IP address in the script:

```bash
SERVER_URL = "http://<FLASK_SERVER_IP>:5000/chat/1"
```

Run the device client:

```bash
python3 raspcode.py
```
